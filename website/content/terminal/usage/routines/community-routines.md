Community routines will enable the community to share their investment research routines and streamline everyone's investment research workflow.

This is where you can find them: [https://my.openbb.co/app/terminal/community-routines/new](https://my.openbb.co/app/terminal/community-routines/new?size=25&tags=&page=1)

There are 3 categories where you can find a collection of scripts:

- **Hot**: High rate of recent upvotes

- **Popular**: Most-voted scripts

- **New**: Recently added scripts

The icon on the left allows you to upvote your favorite scripts and see how many times they have been voted by the community.

In addition, if you are looking for a specific script, you can use the advanced search field to filter by username, description, tags, and even date time.

When clicking on one of these scripts, you’ll be able to access the information associated with it - the username, title, description, and the script itself.

Plus you’ll have 2 possible actions:

- Save that routine to your personal collection - so you can edit it directly on the Hub and save it for terminal usage.

- Download the routine to your desktop - so you can share it with others or tweak it locally.

When you click on the “Share” icon associated with a routine, you’ll be prompted with a link to share that routine with your colleagues.

The goal is that more users can benefit from other users' investment research workflow.

If you select the check box “Run on terminal”, an “exe” will be added at the start of the link so you can copy-paste it into the OpenBB Terminal to run that same script.

Finally, users can set their scripts to public or keep them private.

In the screenshot below, you have a private routine that implements the new TimeGPT-1 (Beta) model from our friends at Nixtla.

Also, don’t forget to set your socials on your account so other OpenBB users can reach out to you to ask you more questions about your routines.

We hope you take advantage of this exciting addition and learn how to use one of the best features the terminal has to offer.
