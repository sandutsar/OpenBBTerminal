<HeadTitle title="Forex - Menus | OpenBB Terminal Docs" />

The Forex menu includes features for historical prices, forward rates, and real-time exchange rates.  It also provides entry points to the [`/ta/`](/terminal/menus/common/ta.md), [`/qa`](/terminal/menus/common/qa.md), and [`/forecast`](/terminal/menus/forecast.md) menus.


## Usage

The Forex menu is entered by typing `forex`, from the Main menu, or with the absolute path:

```console
/forex
```

### Load

The first step will be to load a pair of currencies.  The pairs are entered as a six-letter symbol, with the former of the pair being "from".

```console
load JPYUSD
```

Inversely:

```console
load USDJPY
```

### Quote

A `quote` from YahooFinance displays the last price and a timestamp when it was refreshed.

```console
/forex/load JPYUSD/quote
```

```console
Quote for JPY/USD

Last refreshed : 2023-11-03 19:30:00
Last value     : 0.006694381590932608
```

From AlphaVantage, a table is returned that includes a bid and ask.

```console
quote --source AlphaVantage
```
