The Comparison Analysis menu features different methods for comparing price, volume, and fundamentals across multiple stocks.

## Usage

Enter the menu from the `/stocks` menu.  If a ticker is not already loaded, enter one now by using the `ticker` command.

```console
/stocks/ca/ticker AMD
```

### Get

The `get` command will attempt to find the company peers of the base ticker.

```console
get --source Polygon
```

```console
[Polygon] Similar Companies: AMD, INTC, MCHP, NVDA, TXN, HPQ, XLK 
```

Refreshing the screen, `?` or `h` with no command, will update the list of similar companies.

### RMV

Use the syntax below to remove a ticker from the list:

```console
rmv xlk
```

```console
[Polygon] Similar Companies: AMD, INTC, MCHP, NVDA, TXN, HPQ
```

### Add

Similarly, add another one by using the `add` command.

```console
add mu
```

```console
[Custom] Similar Companies: HPQ, MCHP, TXN, INTC, MU, AMD, NVDA 
```

### Technical

With a list of similar companies populated, the `technical` command will compare recent price performance metrics.

```console

```
