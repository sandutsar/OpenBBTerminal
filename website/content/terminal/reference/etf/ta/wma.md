A Weighted Moving Average puts more weight on recent data and less on past data. This is done by multiplying each barâ€™s price by a weighting factor. Because of its unique calculation, WMA will follow prices more closely than a corresponding Simple Moving Average.

### Usage

```python
wma [-l N_LENGTH] [-o N_OFFSET]
```
