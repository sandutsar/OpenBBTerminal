In the realm of investment research, financial data often comes in tabular form. This is because it's predominantly quantitative, and analysts and quants frequently need to delve into the raw data to make informed decisions. To enhance your navigation experience through this data, we've incorporated basic data manipulation capabilities.

## Column Resizing

You have the flexibility to manually adjust the width of the table columns. Alternatively, you can use the "Autosize all columns" feature for automatic resizing.

## Column Reorganization

Reorganize your columns effortlessly with our drag-and-drop feature. Simply click and hold the mouse on the column header and drag it to your desired position.

## Column Filtering

To reduce visual clutter, you can temporarily hide any columns that aren't currently relevant to your analysis. This can be done easily in the column settings.

## Sorting

By clicking on a column header, you can sort the data in ascending or descending order based on that column's values.

## Transposing

Our platform allows you to transpose tables, turning columns into rows and vice versa. This feature can be particularly useful for rendering time series from tabular data.
