In the dynamic world of investment research, the ability to accurately model and forecast financial time series is a crucial skill. OpenBB Terminal Pro empowers you to do just that, right from our user-friendly interface. Simply select the time series you wish to model or forecast, choose your preferred model, and voila! A chart is generated, displaying your selected time series alongside the forecast or model you've chosen.

To get you started, we offer the following out-of-the-box solutions:

* **Linear Regression**: This is a fundamental statistical and machine learning method. It's used to understand the relationship between two variables, with one being the predictor or independent variable and the other being the response or dependent variable.

* **Nixtla's GPT (API key required)**: This is a state-of-the-art forecasting model. It's designed to handle a wide range of time series patterns, making it a versatile tool for your forecasting needs. Please note that an API key is required to use this feature.
