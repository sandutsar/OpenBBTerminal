OpenBB's primary role is to aggregate and standardize financial data. So, we empower data vendors by showcasing their data through our products, providing them with an application where they are able to monetize their offerings to OpenBB users.

Each widget in OpenBB is powered by a specific data provider. In some instances, multiple data vendors may supply the same type of data. You are in control to choose the right data vendor based on factors such as data quality, availability, trustworthiness, and cost.

To enhance transparency, OpenBB allows you to see the source of your data and the last time the data endpoint was accessed. With the help of the staleness indicator, you can easily determine the freshness of your data.
